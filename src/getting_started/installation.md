# Installation

To install the plugin you need to download the latest version of it from the
[GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/liquip/liquip-plugin/releases) and put the inside of your
servers plugin directory. In the following guide you will be taught to do so step by step.

## Prerequisites

To use the plugin you need the following:

* Java 17 or higher
* Paper 1.19 server (other versions are not tested)

## Installing Java

To install Java you can go to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net). They provide prebuilt Java-binaries
and even installers for Java.

## Installing Paper

To install Paper please follow [this](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started) guide.

## Installing the plugin

The last step to installing Liquip is downloading the plugin from
the [releases tab](https://github.com/liquip/liquip-plugin/releases) on our GitHub.

On that page search for a file called somewhat similar to `liquip-paper-standalone-1.0.0-beta.jar`.


This is the plugin archive you can then download and put into the `plugins` directory inside the
directory you installed your paper server to.

After that restart your server, and you should be good to go.
